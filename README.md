## Home Assistant Configuration Files

I am using Home Assistant on a Raspberry Pi B+ to automate a number of systems within my house.

The Raspberry Pi was configured using the Home Assistant ready made image which I then installed sky-command-cli npm package on. This allows me to control my Sky HD box remotely and, if I wish, automate it.
